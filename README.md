Global Fund for Children

Project Statement

 “Global Fund for Children wants to use data on the organizational development of grantee partners and inputs provided by GFC during the course of the funding relationship to better understand the link between the services and funding provided and self-reported changes in organizational health. This will assist GFC to better understand which interventions are most successful at contributing to positive organizational changes. As a result, GFC can more effectively target services to enable organizations that aim to improve the lives of children and youth affected by poverty, injustice and discrimination worldwide to be more effective at their work.”
 


Outputs:

·         Budget increase-can be found in all grant data spreadsheet

·         Number directly served-can be found in all grant data spreadsheet

·         Visibility-In “awards data” tab of “major awards” spreadsheet. We do not have data for social media followers but would be interested in seeing if we can find that information.

·         OCI increase-can be found in all grant data spreadsheet and OCI generator.

·         Program outcomes-can be found in all grant data spreadsheet. The program outcomes are more accurate since we incorporated an outcome question in our online application in 2012, but as I have noted, the grantee partners can choose from dozens of program outcomes to report from, so the challenge will be aggregating those different categories.
 
Inputs:

·         Total grant amount per partner-can be found in total grant amount per partner spreadsheet. Please be aware that some supplemental grants have been awarded to organizations that never received primary grants. We do not expect to track the outputs of those organizations. All Affinity Grants should be disregarded. Those grants are used for membership fees in other networks.

·         Type of grants, particularly organizational development awards- can be found in all grant data spreadsheet

·         Grant use-can be found in all grant data spreadsheet, Column V, “Grant Use Sentence.” These are narrative sentences-is there a way to analyze if there is a connection about what the grants were used for and outputs?

·         Leveraging-can be found in all activities spreadsheet

·         Site Visits-can be found in all activities spreadsheet

·         Knowledge Exchanges-can be found in all activities spreadsheet

·         Other inputs-can include GFC-led convenings, additional touch, emails, phone calls, and legal referrals. These activities are not very numerous.
